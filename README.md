Sample repo showing 2 ways of simple integration of Spring Boot and Apache Wicket framework.
One based on DI (dependency injection) based approach, the other on SL (service locator) pattern 
for discovering of Spring beans.

Both have been started with a simple Spring Boot quick start project 
created and downloaded at https://start.spring.io .
